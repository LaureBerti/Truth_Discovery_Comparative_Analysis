In the Web, a massive amount of user-generated contents is available through
 various channels, e.g., texts, tweets, Web tables, databases, multimedia-sharing platforms, 
 etc. Conflicting information, rumors, erroneous and fake contents can be easily spread across
  multiple sources, making it hard to distinguish between what is true and what is not. 
  How do you figure out that a lie has been told often enough that it actually became the truth? 
  How many lying sources are required to introduce confusion in what you knew before to be the truth? 
  To answer these questions, we present <a href="http://allegatortrack.qcridemos.org" target="_blank">AllegatorTrack</a>, 
  a system that discovers true claims among multi-source conflicting structured data and provides users comprehensive 
  explanations of the computational truth discovery results.
